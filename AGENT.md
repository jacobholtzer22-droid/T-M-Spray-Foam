Site Build Agent
You are filling in an Align & Acquire site template for one client. Everything you need is in `BRIEF.md` and `public/images/originals/`. Work through all phases, then run the gate. Do not ask for confirmation between phases.
Absolute rules

1. Never invent a business fact. No phone numbers, addresses, hours, prices, founding years, license numbers, service areas, certifications, review counts, or ratings that are not in `BRIEF.md`. If the brief lists something under UNKNOWN, the corresponding config field is `null` and the block does not render. An empty slot is correct. A plausible guess is a defect.
2. Never type a fact into content. Phone numbers, addresses, and prices go in `site.config.ts` and reach the page through the `<Phone />` component or config interpolation. Prose that hardcodes a fact will fail verification.
3. Never write a JSON-LD block. Schema comes from `lib/schema.ts`. If a page needs schema you think is missing, say so in your final report. Do not hand-write it.
4. Never edit `components/ContactForm.tsx`. It is checksum-verified.
5. Never add Review or aggregateRating schema. It renders automatically from `config.reviews`, which you populate only from real reviews supplied in the brief with a source URL.
6. `businessSlug` is a hardcoded string literal from the brief. Never an environment variable. If the brief does not contain it, stop and say so; it is the one thing you cannot proceed without.

Phase 1: Config
Fill `site.config.ts` entirely from `BRIEF.md`.

* Every field the brief supplies gets a real value.
* Every field the brief does not supply gets `null` or an empty array. Do not approximate.
* Pick `schemaType` from the allowlist based on the trade. Landscaping and general outdoor trades use `HomeAndConstructionBusiness`. There is no `LandscapingBusiness` type; it does not exist.
* Service slugs are kebab-case from the service name. Area slugs are kebab-case from the city name.
* For each service, write three to six FAQs based on questions real customers in that trade ask. FAQ answers must be answerable from brief facts. If a natural question requires a fact you do not have (typical price, warranty length), either omit the question or write an answer that explains what determines the answer and invites a quote, without inventing a number.

Then run `npx tsc --noEmit` and confirm the config parses.
Phase 2: Design direction
This phase decides whether the site looks bought or built. It is not optional.
2a. Look at the photos first.
Before choosing anything, view every image in `public/images/originals/`. What is in them determines the design. Note whether they are bright or moody, wide or tight, professional or phone-shot, whether people appear, and whether there is a dominant color.
Write two sentences on what the photography is actually like. If the photos are poor quality or too few to carry a photo-led design, say so now and design around it with type and color instead of fighting it.
2b. Pick one direction and commit fully. A half-applied direction reads as an accident.
Heavy iron (junk removal, excavation, tree service, truck repair, demolition) Charcoal or near-black base, safety orange or amber accent, condensed bold display type (Oswald, Archivo Black, Bebas Neue) against a plain sans body. Hard edges, minimal border radius, heavy rules between sections. Equipment and scale in the photography. Confidence, not polish.
Cultivated (landscaping, hardscaping, lawn care, garden design) Deep green or near-black base with a warm off-white, one muted accent. Serif display face (Fraunces, Instrument Serif, Playfair Display) with a clean sans body. Generous whitespace, large photography, soft radius, unhurried spacing. Restraint reads as expensive here.
Trade professional (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing) Navy or slate base, one strong accent, blue or red, not both. Geometric sans throughout (Sora, Manrope, Space Grotesk) with real weight contrast. Grid-driven layout. Credentials, licensing, and response time get visual emphasis. Trust over beauty.
Showroom (auto detailing, painting, remodeling, flooring) Near-black base, high-contrast photography doing all the work. Thin uppercase letterspaced labels, minimal chrome, tight type. Before-and-after treatment where the brief supplies pairs. The work is the design.
2c. Build the theme for real. Fill `theme.ts` and the Tailwind config. All of these:

* Two faces from Google Fonts via `next/font`. The display face must have character. Never Inter, system-ui, or Arial for headings. Hero H1 at `clamp(2.5rem, 6vw, 4.5rem)`, body 17 to 18px, hard contrast between H2 and body.
* One dark neutral, one warm or cool off-white, exactly one accent. The accent covers under 5% of any page. No gradient text. No purple-to-blue gradient. No pure `#000000` or `#FFFFFF`.
* Hero: full-bleed client photograph with a dark scrim, headline and phone CTA left-aligned in the lower third. Not a centered headline on flat color. If the photos cannot carry it, use a split layout with a large photo on one side and oversized type on the other.
* Sections alternate visual treatment. At least one full-dark section on the homepage. Minimum `py-24` on desktop.
* One button shape, one radius, one accent fill, everywhere. Sticky tap-to-call bar on mobile, always reachable.
* One radius value and one shadow value for the whole site.

Where these live in this template: the two faces are declared in `app/fonts.ts` (swap the `next/font/google` imports, keep the `variable` names); palette, `heroVariant` (`full-bleed` or `split`), `radius`, and `shadow` are in `theme.ts`; the hero H1 size, body size, tap-to-call bar, and full-dark gallery section are already built into the components and read those values. Do not add a second radius or shadow anywhere.
2d. Banned patterns. None of these appear:

* A three-column row of icon cards with one-line labels
* Centered hero headline on flat color with two stacked buttons
* Placeholder or stock-looking imagery of any kind
* Rounded cards with drop shadows floating on light gray
* Emoji used as icons
* A "Why Choose Us" section with checkmarks
* More than two font weights per face doing decorative work

2e. Print the photography assessment, the chosen direction with a one-line reason, and the full `theme.ts`. Then continue.
Phase 3: Images

1. Run `npm run images`.
2. Open `public/images/manifest.json`. For every entry, actually view the image file and write descriptive alt text naming what is depicted and, where honest, the service and city. Ten to twenty words.
3. Verify by filename, not by position. After writing all alts, pick five entries at random, re-view those exact files, and confirm the alt matches. Print the five filenames and their alts in your report.
4. Choose which images go in the hero, service pages, and gallery, and record the choices in `site.config.ts` or the relevant MDX.

Phase 4: Content
Write MDX for the homepage, about page, each service, and each area.
Structure for a service page:

* The page template renders the H1 (`<Service> in <Primary City>`) from config. MDX must not contain a top-level `#` heading; a `#` in any content file fails the build. Body sections start at `##`.
* Opening paragraph: one to two sentences answering who does what, where. This is the extraction target for AI search engines. No slogan fluff.
* Two to four body sections with `##` headings phrased as questions customers ask ("How much does tree removal cost?", "How long does it take?"), not vague labels ("Our Process", "Why Us").
* Facts referenced through components and config interpolation only.

Every content file needs a frontmatter `description` of 140 to 160 characters; the gate measures it.
Area pages must contain content genuinely specific to that area. If you cannot write anything true and specific about a city beyond its name, say so in your report rather than producing filler. Filler area pages are worse than no area pages.
Homepage copy: write it, but flag in your report that the human should rewrite it. Generated homepage copy is the weakest output of this process.
Phase 5: Build, look at it, fix it

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Start the dev server and screenshot the homepage, one service page, one area page, and the contact page at 390px and 1440px. Eight screenshots.
3. Look at every screenshot. Write down the three things that most make this site look templated or unfinished. Be specific and harsh. "Spacing could be better" is not an answer. "The service grid is a three-column card row that reads as a Bootstrap default" is.
4. Fix all three.
5. Re-screenshot and confirm the fixes landed.

Phase 6: Gate

1. Run `npm run verify`.
2. If it fails, fix and re-run. Maximum three attempts.
3. If it still fails after three attempts, stop. Print the full failure output and what you tried. Do not disable, weaken, or work around a check. A check that is inconvenient is a check that is doing its job.

Phase 7: Report
Commit your work to a branch named `build/<businessSlug>`. Do not merge. Do not push. Do not deploy.
Then print, in this order:

1. The full `npm run verify` output table.
2. The complete `site.config.ts`.
3. The five random alt-text spot checks from Phase 3.
4. The design direction chosen in Phase 2, with its one-line reason.
5. The three templated-looking things found in Phase 5 and what was changed to fix each.
6. UNRESOLVED: every fact the brief left unknown, which config field is null because of it, and which page section is consequently not rendering. This is the list the human acts on.
7. INVENTED: anything you were tempted to fill in and did not. If this list is empty, say so explicitly.
8. Anything you believe is wrong with the template itself.

Do not summarize what you built. The verify output and the config are the report.
